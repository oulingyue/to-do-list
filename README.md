# To-Do List App
I made this todo list with the intention of expanding the project into a more complex application in the future. Ultimately it is a simple todo-list web application with a REACT frontend a flask backend with REST API.


## Features
I originally wanted to do a coffee shop review application, thus the UI is warm chocolate brown tone themed. 

- Add and delete tasks.
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- REST API for CRUD operations
- simple, responsive frontend UI
- MySQL database stored on local machine to manage tasks. 

##  Tech Stack
### Frontend
- React (Hooks, Fetch/Axios)
### Backend
- Python Flask (REST API)
- Flask-CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
## Database 
- MySQL
